# Summary of workshop

## Overall summary

The workshop was very impactful and benefited from the engagement of representives across the BRCs (from early career to PIs). We all came together to discuss and quantify the "core" microbiome betweeen BRC feedstocks.  This output was successfully accomplished. This conversation, however, ended up being what brought us together. The discussions of the workshop were broader spanning towards future opportunities that could most benefit from our collaborations.  

## Detailed Activities 
We began the workshop by identifying what the critical needs that would be served by inter-BRC collaborations would be.  Individuals were asked to contribute ideas, and then we grouped them together to identify main themes [photos](https://github.com/germs-lab/brc-data/tree/main/workshop_discussions/brainstorm_wishlist). Some themes that workshop participants thought were important for the inter-BRC efforts to consider:

* Linking function to our questions
* Carbon sequestration dedicated research efforts
* Characterization Core
* Sharing methods, databases, standards
* Growing Isolates Resources
* Characterzing Complex Interactions

We had four research talks from each BRC.  Many workshop participants noted that this was their favorite part of the workshop because of the time to discuss ongoing research.  All four talks were amazing.

In the afternoon, we hosted a tutorial to walk all participants, regardless of programming background, on how to implement criteria for defining a core on a small 16S rRNA sequencing dataset representing data across all four BRCs.  The workshop was effective for all participants.

The next day, we discussed the results of the tutorial and the identified [core](https://github.com/germs-lab/brc-data/tree/main/workshop_discussions/core_definition_brainstorm) and potential next steps.  The team had enthusiasm for a collaborative paper discussing the core microbiome of BRC crops including:

* History of core definitions
* Applications of how the core has helped us understand microbial interactions
* Case studies from BRCs of defining a core and its impact (Fertilization impacts, drought impacts, and within and across site diversity)

Two teams were created, one to synthesize literature and concepts and one to perform the analysis on BRC datasets.
