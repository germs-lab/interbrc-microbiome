It is hosted by the GERMS lab at Iowa State University.

### Workshop goal: Enable shared access and interactions with plant microbiome data across BRCs.
* Communication of plant microbe objectives across BRCs
* Update of BRC scientists on development of plant microbial shared research resources
* Training on plant microbiome dataset management
* Training on identification of core microbiome between BRC datasets (Goal is to have each BRC feedstock represented and identification of core taxa)
