We are excited you have expressed interest in the Inter-BRC Microbiome Workshop to be held in Ames, Iowa on September 9 - 10.  To confirm your plans to attend please complete this [online registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfR9CHtMowWZBK-ZRhNPGEkUa-S-qxNZWnEr9yJS5MvVDb4rA/viewform) no later than Friday, August 16.

### Air Travel
The closest airport is DSM, which is about 45 minutes from Ames.  

 
### Local Transportation
Iowa Stateâ€™s recommended airport shuttle, linked here, must be arranged ahead of time. Uber is often available, but may be unreliable. There is car rental on-site at the airport.

### Hotel
We have a group reservation at [Comfort Inn and Suites Ames](https://www.choicehotels.com/reservations/groups/me87c9?checkInDate=2024-09-08&checkOutDate=2024-09-10&ratePlanCode=BNBTKD), with a group rate of $107 per night available for reservations placed by Friday August 9.  We are currently trying to extend this rate, but [booking directly through the hotel](https://www.choicehotels.com/iowa/ames/comfort-inn-hotels) is also very reasonable. We will provide transport from hotel to the workshop on Monday and Tuesday as needed.  If you would like a hotel within walking distance, the [Iowa House Bed & Breakfast](https://iowahouseames.com/) is a nice option and is a 0.8 mile walk to the workshop location.

### Workshop Location
The workshop will be held in Room 1306 Elings Hall at Iowa State University. Limited parking is available nearby and can be reserved by contacting Lorien Radmer, lradmer@iastate.edu 

### Workshop prerequisites
A laptop is required.  We will be providing some papers to read before the workshop and install directions for software used during the workshop. Please fill in this anonymous [pre-workshop assessment](https://forms.gle/1Q2qT3F799v35P8x5), which allows us to understand the skills of the participants and also your goals.  The workshop will also require some prerequisites. [Prerequisites can be found here](https://www.germslab.org/interbrc-microbiome/prep.html)
